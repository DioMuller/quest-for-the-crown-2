# Quest for the Crown 2

This is the repository for Quest for the Crown 2, a game made for my PUCPR Game Development Postgrad.

## Description
This is a top-down exploration game, made using Monogame. All assets and libraries necessary are included. To create and edit maps, you can use Tiled.

## Environment
Since technology is ever evolving, I cannot guarantee this game will work indefinitely. It was made using those tools:

* Visual Studio 2012
* Monogame 3.0
* Tiled

While backwards compatibility and automatic conversion may work for future versions, there may be errors and inconsistencies.

## Contributing
Since this project is a personal project created for education pruposes, no external contributions will be accepted. However, you are free to fork and study the code!

## License
